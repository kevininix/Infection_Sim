# Infection_Sim
A simple NumPy + Pygame simulation of disease spreading, following the SIR model's classification of the population as **S**usceptible, **I**nfected and **R**ecovered, with a real-time graph of the evolution of the disease in terms of the infected, recovered and diseased. 

Other settings include a mortality rate, a velocity randomizer (for random walk), number of quarantined individuals, number of initial infections, and a function to control the speed of recovery/death.
